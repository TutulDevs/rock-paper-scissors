# Rock, Paper, Scissors


* This is a [challenge](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors) by The Odin Project in JavaScript. Currently it can be played in browser console only. After learning DOM, I'll add style to this.
* It has five rounds and you can input both uppercase and lowercase in the prompt.
